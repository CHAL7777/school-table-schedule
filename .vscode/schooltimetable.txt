 School Timetable App – Explained Simply
 What Is This App?
This app is a simple school timetable manager built using Java. It lets you:

View the timetable for the week

Add or change subjects for any class period

Do all of that right from the keyboard in a clean menu format

It’s like a tiny assistant for managing school schedules — especially useful for students, teachers, or anyone organizing classes.

 What Can It Do?
Here’s what you can do with it:

See the full week’s timetable — from Monday to Friday

Update a subject — if “Math” was mistakenly put where “Science” should be, just fix it!

Keep it tidy — every subject sits in its own time slot so your week stays organized

Everything happens through a simple menu, where you type numbers to make choices. No clutter, no confusion.

 How Does It Work?
There's a timetable manager behind the scenes storing all the subjects.
It shows you the timetable in a clean table.
You can change any class by choosing the day, the class number, and typing in the new subject.
Even better? The app is built with good coding practices:

It keeps data safe and organized (encapsulation).
It hides technical details and only shows what you need (abstraction).
You can use it in schools, colleges, or even just to practice organizing tasks in your own week.
This timetable app is a small project with a big purpose: helping organize time in a way that’s easy, clear, and customizable. And because it’s written in Java using real-world programming concepts, it’s also a great learning tool.
